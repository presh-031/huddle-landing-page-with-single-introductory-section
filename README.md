## Overview

The designs replicated were made for 375px and 1440px device widths, according to the style-guide.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-I learnt more about sass workflow, creating \_config files and importing them to the main stylesheet. We can also style different sections of a webpage on different stylesheets and import them to the main stylesheet for that webpage. This is better than linking multiple stylesheets to an html file (as in vanilla css) because it requires fewer HTTP requests from the server, hence better user-experience,which of course, is priority.

### Continued development

I'll use more sass features on future projects that permit so.

### Useful resources

Brad traversy's sass crash coursse helped to get me up and running with using sass on my personal projects.
